# text-worlds
###### A text-based, creative, collaborative experience.

**Here is it how it works:**

    - You create a world or log into one.
    - You create a character that fits the world.
    - You start writing either as your character or as the narrator of the world. 

**More:**

    - People can see how the story has developed in a grpah and who has interacted with what events or other characters.
    - It is all text based, no graphical characters.
    - What you write, you write as your character, not as a user. Users can have many characters.
    - People can downvote a part of the story they don't like so it doesn't become part of the official story.
    - People can "fork" worlds and continue writing on alternate story-lines.
